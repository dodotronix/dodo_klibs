# DODO's kicad libraries for Kicad version 5.99 and higher
This library contains different groups of components which I missed in actual 
kicad's libraries.
Actually there are following groups of components. The library will be updated 
so more groups will appear.
Component groups:
* Logics - components for logic circuits like buffers, gates, registers

## INSTALL
* Choose the path for your Kicad libraries not with root privileges otherwise 
the library will not be usable within normal users
* Open Kicad and click on symbol editor
* Click on "File" -> "Add library..."

## UNINSTALL
* remove this repository from your library location
